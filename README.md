# The Master Algorithm
How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World

# Prologue

# CHAPTER ONE The Machine-Learning Revolution

## Enter the learner
Computers write their own programs

## Why businesses embrace machine learning
They embrace it because they have no choice.

## Supercharging the scientific method
It follows the
same process of generating, testing, and discarding or refining hypotheses.
But while a scientist may spend his or her whole life coming up
with and testing a few hundred hypotheses, a machine-learning system
can do the same in a fraction of a second

## A billion Bill Clintons
In the future, provided voter models are accurate, elected offcials will be able to ask voters what they
want a thousand times a day and act accordingly—without having to
pester the actual esh-and-blood citizens.

## One if by land, two if by Internet
Out in cyberspace, learning algorithms man the nation’s ramparts.

## Where are we headed?
What makes this possible? How do learning algorithms work? What
can’t they currently do, and what will the next generation look like?
How will the machine-learning revolution unfold? And what opportunities
and dangers should you look out for?

# CHAPTER TWO The Master Algorithm

**All knowledge—past, present, and future—can be derived from
data by a single, universal learning algorithm**

## The argument from neuroscience
In congenitally blind people, the visual cortex can take over other
brain functions

## The argument from evolution
Life’s infinite variety is the result of a single mechanism: natural selection.

## The argument from physics
physics is unique in its simplicity. Outside physics and
engineering, the track record of mathematics is more mixed

## The argument from statistics
Bayes’ theorem is a machine that turns data into knowledge

## The argument from computer science
P and NP are the two most important classes of problems in computer
science

## Machine learners versus knowledge engineers
we should keep
their criticisms in mind as we set out on the road to the Master Algorithm
