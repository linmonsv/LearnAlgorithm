# The Master Algorithm
How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World

# Prologue

# CHAPTER ONE The Machine-Learning Revolution

## Enter the learner
Computers write their own programs

## Why businesses embrace machine learning
They embrace it because they have no choice.

## Supercharging the scientific method
It follows the
same process of generating, testing, and discarding or refining hypotheses.
But while a scientist may spend his or her whole life coming up
with and testing a few hundred hypotheses, a machine-learning system
can do the same in a fraction of a second

## A billion Bill Clintons
In the future, provided voter models are accurate, elected offcials will be able to ask voters what they
want a thousand times a day and act accordingly—without having to
pester the actual esh-and-blood citizens.

## One if by land, two if by Internet
Out in cyberspace, learning algorithms man the nation’s ramparts.

## Where are we headed?
What makes this possible? How do learning algorithms work? What
can’t they currently do, and what will the next generation look like?
How will the machine-learning revolution unfold? And what opportunities
and dangers should you look out for?

# CHAPTER TWO The Master Algorithm

**All knowledge—past, present, and future—can be derived from
data by a single, universal learning algorithm**

## The argument from neuroscience
In congenitally blind people, the visual cortex can take over other
brain functions

## The argument from evolution
Life’s infinite variety is the result of a single mechanism: natural selection.

## The argument from physics
physics is unique in its simplicity. Outside physics and
engineering, the track record of mathematics is more mixed

## The argument from statistics
Bayes’ theorem is a machine that turns data into knowledge

## The argument from computer science
P and NP are the two most important classes of problems in computer
science

## Machine learners versus knowledge engineers
we should keep
their criticisms in mind as we set out on the road to the Master Algorithm

## Swan bites robot
“No matter how smart your algorithm, there are some things it just
can’t learn.”

## Is the Master Algorithm a fox or a hedgehog?
I hope the Master Algorithm
is a hedgehog, but even if it’s a fox, we can’t catch it soon enough.

Before we can discover deep truths with machine learning,
we have to discover deep truths about machine learning

## What’s at stake
Machine learning alone will not
cure cancer; cancer patients will, by sharing their data for the benet of
future patients

## A different theory of everything
A theory is a set of constraints on what the
world could be, not a complete description of it. To obtain the latter,
you have to combine the theory with data

## Candidates that don’t make the cut
Mathematicians like to say that God can disobey the
laws of physics, but even he cannot defy the laws of logic. is may be
so, but the laws of logic are for deduction; what we need is something
equivalent, but for induction

## The Five tribes of machine learning
* symbolists
* connectionists
* evolutionaries
* Bayesians
* analogizers

# CHAPTER THREE Hume’s Problem of Induction
* Rationalists
* Empiricists

## To date or not to date?
without generalization, you won’t even get o
the ground

## The "no free lunch" theorem
there’s no such thing as learning without knowledge

## Priming the knowledge pump
Suspend your disbelief and start by assuming that all
matches are good

## How to rule the world
“divide and conquer”

## Between blindness and hallucination
appropriately
enough, Probably Approximately Correct.

## Accuracy you can believe in
You can estimate the bias and variance of a learner by comparing its
predictions aer learning on random variations of the training set

## Induction is the inverse of deduction
Socrates is human.
All humans are mortal.
Terefore.... . .?...

## Learning to cure cancer
inverse deduction is a great way to discover new knowledge
in biology

## A game of twenty questions
decision tree

## The symbolists
The symbolists’ core belief is that all intelligence can be reduced to
manipulating symbols

# CHAPTER FOUR How Does Your Brain Learn?
the molecular biology of synaptic
change

## The rise and fall of the perceptron
our goal is to develop a general-purpose learning algorithm, not
to build a realistic model of the brain

## Physicist makes brain out of glass
* Spin glasses
* Boltzmann machine
* deep learning

## The most important curve in the world
Many phenomena we think of
as linear are in fact S curves, because nothing can grow without limit.

## Climbing mountains in hyperspace
Backprop

## The perceptron’s revenge
Neural networks’ rst big success was in predicting the stock market.

## A complete model of a cell
a nonlinear system

## Deeper into the brain
the top layer can be a conventional perceptron that learns
to recognize your grandmother from the high-level features provided
by the layer below it—much easier than using only the crude information
provided by a single hidden layer or than trying to backpropagate
through all the layers at once
