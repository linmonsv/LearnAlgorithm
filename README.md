# The Master Algorithm
How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World

# Prologue

# CHAPTER ONE The Machine-Learning Revolution

## Enter the learner
Computers write their own programs

## Why businesses embrace machine learning
They embrace it because they have no choice.

## Supercharging the scientific method
It follows the
same process of generating, testing, and discarding or refining hypotheses.
But while a scientist may spend his or her whole life coming up
with and testing a few hundred hypotheses, a machine-learning system
can do the same in a fraction of a second

## A billion Bill Clintons
In the future, provided voter models are accurate, elected offcials will be able to ask voters what they
want a thousand times a day and act accordingly—without having to
pester the actual esh-and-blood citizens.

## One if by land, two if by Internet
Out in cyberspace, learning algorithms man the nation’s ramparts.

## Where are we headed?
What makes this possible? How do learning algorithms work? What
can’t they currently do, and what will the next generation look like?
How will the machine-learning revolution unfold? And what opportunities
and dangers should you look out for?

# CHAPTER TWO The Master Algorithm

**All knowledge—past, present, and future—can be derived from
data by a single, universal learning algorithm**

## The argument from neuroscience
In congenitally blind people, the visual cortex can take over other
brain functions

## The argument from evolution
Life’s infinite variety is the result of a single mechanism: natural selection.

## The argument from physics
physics is unique in its simplicity. Outside physics and
engineering, the track record of mathematics is more mixed

## The argument from statistics
Bayes’ theorem is a machine that turns data into knowledge

## The argument from computer science
P and NP are the two most important classes of problems in computer
science

## Machine learners versus knowledge engineers
we should keep
their criticisms in mind as we set out on the road to the Master Algorithm

## Swan bites robot
“No matter how smart your algorithm, there are some things it just
can’t learn.”

## Is the Master Algorithm a fox or a hedgehog?
I hope the Master Algorithm
is a hedgehog, but even if it’s a fox, we can’t catch it soon enough.

Before we can discover deep truths with machine learning,
we have to discover deep truths about machine learning

## What’s at stake
Machine learning alone will not
cure cancer; cancer patients will, by sharing their data for the benet of
future patients

## A different theory of everything
A theory is a set of constraints on what the
world could be, not a complete description of it. To obtain the latter,
you have to combine the theory with data

## Candidates that don’t make the cut
Mathematicians like to say that God can disobey the
laws of physics, but even he cannot defy the laws of logic. is may be
so, but the laws of logic are for deduction; what we need is something
equivalent, but for induction

## The Five tribes of machine learning
* symbolists
* connectionists
* evolutionaries
* Bayesians
* analogizers

# CHAPTER THREE Hume’s Problem of Induction
* Rationalists
* Empiricists

## To date or not to date?
without generalization, you won’t even get o
the ground

## The "no free lunch" theorem
there’s no such thing as learning without knowledge

## Priming the knowledge pump
Suspend your disbelief and start by assuming that all
matches are good

## How to rule the world
“divide and conquer”

## Between blindness and hallucination
appropriately
enough, Probably Approximately Correct.

## Accuracy you can believe in
You can estimate the bias and variance of a learner by comparing its
predictions aer learning on random variations of the training set

## Induction is the inverse of deduction
Socrates is human.
All humans are mortal.
Terefore.... . .?...

## Learning to cure cancer
inverse deduction is a great way to discover new knowledge
in biology

## A game of twenty questions
decision tree

## The symbolists
The symbolists’ core belief is that all intelligence can be reduced to
manipulating symbols

# CHAPTER FOUR How Does Your Brain Learn?
the molecular biology of synaptic
change

## The rise and fall of the perceptron
our goal is to develop a general-purpose learning algorithm, not
to build a realistic model of the brain

## Physicist makes brain out of glass
* Spin glasses
* Boltzmann machine
* deep learning

## The most important curve in the world
Many phenomena we think of
as linear are in fact S curves, because nothing can grow without limit.

## Climbing mountains in hyperspace
Backprop

## The perceptron’s revenge
Neural networks’ rst big success was in predicting the stock market.

## A complete model of a cell
a nonlinear system

## Deeper into the brain
the top layer can be a conventional perceptron that learns
to recognize your grandmother from the high-level features provided
by the layer below it—much easier than using only the crude information
provided by a single hidden layer or than trying to backpropagate
through all the layers at once

# CHAPTER FIVE Evolution: Nature’s Learning Algorithm
Robotic Park is

in silico instead of in vivo

## Darwin’s algorithm
We can get even fancier by allowing rules for intermediate concepts
to evolve, and then chaining these rules at performance time.

## The exploration-exploitation dilemma
If you’ve found something
that works, should you just keep doing it? Or is it better to try
new things, knowing it could be a waste of time but also might lead to
a better solution?

## 程序的适者生存法则

对程序树而不是字符串进行交叉得出的一个结果就是，生成的程序可以任意大，这让学习活动变得更加灵活

## 性有何用

演化新论者非常重视，，，

机器学习主流学派已经很大程度上把他们忘记

## 先天与后天

演化论者关注的是学习架构，对他们来说，通过参数优化来对演化的架构进行微调，这是次重要的事情。

相反，联结学派更喜欢用一个简单、手工编写的结构，加上许多连接行为，然后让权值学习来完成所有工作

## 谁学的最快，谁就会赢

机器学习是地球上生命之间竞争的最新篇章，更快加速的硬件只是等式的一边，另一边是更加智能的软件

# 第六章 贝叶斯学派：在贝叶斯教堂里

## 统治世界的定理

P(原因 | 结果) = P(原因) * P(原因 | 结果) / P(结果)

贝叶斯定理之所以有用，是因为通常给定原因后，我们就会知道结果

## 所有模型都是错的，但有些却有用

如果学习算法利用贝叶斯定理，且给定原因时，假定结果相互独立，那么该学习算法被称为“朴素贝叶斯分类器”

## 从《尤金·奥涅金》到Siri

隐藏的马尔可夫模型，或者简称为HMM

## 所有东西都有关联，但不是直接关联

贝叶斯网络讲诉这样的故事：A发生了，接着它导致B的发生；

同时，C也发生了，而B和C共同引起D的发生。

为了计算特定事件的概率，我们只需将与之相关事件的概率相乘即可。

## 推理问题

马尔可夫蒙特卡洛理论（Markov chain Monte Carlo， MCMC）

贝叶斯网络中的推理不仅限于计算概率，它也包括为证据找到最可信的解释方法

单个出现可能性大的词语，一起出现时可能性就不那么大了

最重要的是，推理包括做最佳决定，引导这些决定的，不仅仅是不同结果的概率，还有相应的成本

## 掌握贝叶斯学派的方法

把假设当作可能的原因，把数据当作观察到的效果：

P（假设 | 数据） = P（假设） × P（数据 | 假设）/P（数据）

## 马尔可夫权衡证据

马尔可夫网络是一组特征以及对应的权值，特点和权值共同定义概率分布

像贝叶斯网络一样，马尔可夫网络可以通过图表来表示，但它们用无向弧而不用箭头。

两个变量被联结起来，这意味着它们会直接相互依赖，如果它们一起出现在某个体征中

## 逻辑与概率：一对不幸的组合

逻辑无法处理不完整或包含嘈杂因素的信息，这在实验生物学中较普遍，但贝叶斯网络可以沉着地处理这个问题。

贝叶斯学习能对单个数据表起作用，，，

但如果我们拥有的表格超过一个，那么贝叶斯学习就会停滞不前。

利用逻辑，我们可以轻易地写出与所有这些方面相关的规则，然后通过结合相关表格来对它们进行学习，但唯一的条件就是表格没有任何漏洞或误差。
